# Color Picker for OpenCV

Color Picker for OpenCV is a small application for grabbing the color values of any pixel on your monitor. There are plenty of color grabbing utilities out there, but I couldn't find one for Mac that displayed HSV values in the 0-180, 0-255, 0-255 format used by OpenCV, so I made this.
